# gnn-recommender
Graph-based recommender systems with explicit negative feedback encoding. Classic recommender systems usually handle negative feedback only in the loss for better classification, ranking, or rating prediction. The project aims to develop a graph-based recommender system that can directly handle negative items to improve recommendation performance.
